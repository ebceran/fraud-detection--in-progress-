# Fraud Detection Model (In Progress)

This project is an ongoing attempt to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions.  

## Current progress:
- Data loading and preprocessing completed.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in progress.  
- Initial Logistic Regression model being tested.  

## Next steps:
- Improve feature engineering.  
- Test multiple ML algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
- Evaluate metrics: Precision, Recall, F1.  

⚠️ Note: This project is currently in progress and will be updated as new steps are completed.
